        <button class="faq-question">Why can't I sign in to Netflix?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            If you're having trouble signing in, be sure you're using the
            correct email/phone and password. You may need to reset your
            password or check that your device or network is working properly.
            If you receive an error message, visit Netflix Help for
            troubleshooting tips like resetting passwords or updating apps.

        <button class="faq-question">
          How many people can use my account?
        </button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Netflix accounts are intended for people living in the same
            household. If someone outside your household wants access, you'll
            need to purchase an extra member slot on Standard or Premium plans

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What are extra members?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Extra members are users you add from your account—each gets their
            own profile, email, and password. They’re limited to 1 device and,
            depending on your plan, may have ads or HD video only

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How does billing work?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Netflix bills you monthly on the date you subscribed. Billing may
            vary if that date doesn't exist in a month (e.g., 31st) or due to
            time zone differences. You can update payment info or view history
            in your account settings

        <button class="faq-question">How can I keep my account secure?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Use a unique, strong password, sign out of unused devices, avoid
            phishing scams, and enable two‑step verification if available.
            Always check your account activity and report anything suspicious
